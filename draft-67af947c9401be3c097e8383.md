This will be a quick reference to some of the most important Kubernetes concepts and common operations performed when deploying workloads and managing applications.

## From containers to pods

A container is a volatile space that hosts processes within a Linux system. It implements a virtualized environment that is managed by the kernel via the container runtime. In consequence, they are programs that have the goal of setting up a described execution context. A where program names, environment variables, system resources are reproduced from the instructions provided in a `Dockerfile`.

Instead of reproducing the memory and exact storage distribution, a container will aim to reproduce runtime state, so a program wonâ€™t know that it runs within a container.

Then we have pods. And they simply package one or more containers and add cluster properties that will be implemented by the Kubernetes control plane. So a pod can describe the `restartPolicy`, `volumes`, `serviceAccountName` and related properties. The result is that containerized applications can assume they will be restarted if they fail, have access to some provided volume, etc.

Pods are native Kubernetes API objects, and at the end what they provide is a *platform* to schedule a workload on a Kubernetes cluster. Its yaml manifest configures in which manner will cluster resources be provided by Kubernetes in order to execute the workload. It describes the properties that cluster resources should provide for the specified workload.

### Schedule a pod object

To create a pod object in Kubernetes, we query its API with the object description. We can make an HTTP call to the cluster API server, or we can write a `kubectl` command, that will make the call for us. For example, we create the pod `anyPod` with:

```bash
kubectl run anyPod --image=nginx
```

To declaratively define the pod object, we pass a `.yaml` description via the `-f` option:

```bash
kubectl apply -f anyPod.yaml 
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: anyPod
  name: anyPod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: anyPod
    resources: {}
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}
```
